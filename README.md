find and send files to webpage through curr or subdir's
check if file exists or else returne 404 with null
can fix it to check if dir we give is valid//
Added devtest script in package.json : Type in console npm run devtest(runs program through nodemon env ,if app crashes type rs in console)
Can i automate restart when app crashes??//FIXED
FIXED

Test examples:
localhost:3000/test
localhost:3000/dir/a/dir
